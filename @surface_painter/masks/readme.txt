Copy your mask.tif and your layers.cfg here.
Any tif should be supported but for best result, your tif should be:
	- 8-bits
	- LZW compressed

Rename your layers.cfg so it has the same name as your mask :
	- my_awsome_map_mask.tif
	- my_awsome_map_mask.cfg

This way, the dll know which image correspond to which layers.
